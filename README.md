Code and manuscript for the paper "Census Demographics and Chlorpyrifos Use in California's Central Valley, 2011-15:  A Distributional Environmental Justice Analysis"

Data collection and analysis can be reproduced by running scripts in order (eg, `01_clean_data.R` followed by `02_demographics.R`).  The first script assumes access to PUR data files, available at <https://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/pur/purmain.htm>.  

The final script, `14_Bayesian.R`, was not used in preparing the manuscript.
